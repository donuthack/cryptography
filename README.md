RABINA task:
  encrypt messages and decrypt the cryptogram using the Rabin algorithm. According to the option, choose the prime numbers p and q. As the initial message M take     the date of birth.

EL - GAMAL task:
  using the El-Gamal algorithm to encrypt the message M = 14, and then decrypt.

RSA task:
   encrypt СЛОВО plain text according to the RSA algorithm. To generate, use the numbers p and q, which are determined by the penultimate digit j NSC and given in table.

AFFINE task:
  Select the keys and develop a flowchart of the algorithm and a program for encrypting the data file with an affine cipher 2+ (and mod 4) order. The type of affine cipher is determined by the last digit and the number of the record book (NZK).
